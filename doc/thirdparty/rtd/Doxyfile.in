## Include the base Doxyfile of the libarcstk project

@INCLUDE = @DOC_DOXYFILE_BASE@


## Override the following values from included Doxyfile

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.

OUTPUT_DIRECTORY       = "@DOXYGEN_OUTPUT_DIRECTORY@"
# Has to be repeated: base gets the value from root CMakeLists.txt, this
# has to get the value from m.css/CMakeListst.txt.

# The STRIP_FROM_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the path.
# Stripping is only done if one of the specified strings matches the left-hand
# part of the path. The tag can be used to show relative paths in the file list.
# If left blank the directory from which doxygen is run is used as the path to
# strip.
#
# Note that you can specify absolute paths here, but also relative paths, which
# will be relative from the directory where doxygen is started.
# This tag requires that the tag FULL_PATH_NAMES is set to YES.

STRIP_FROM_PATH        = ..
# Must resolve identically to doxygenStripFromPath in conf.py, see here:
# https://exhale.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/configs.html

# The STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH tag can be used to strip a user-defined part of the
# path mentioned in the documentation of a class, which tells the reader which
# header file to include in order to use a class. If left blank only the name of
# the header file containing the class definition is used. Otherwise one should
# specify the list of include paths that are normally passed to the compiler
# using the -I flag.

#STRIP_FROM_INC_PATH    = ..

# If the EXTRACT_PRIV_VIRTUAL tag is set to YES, documented private virtual
# methods of a class will be included in the documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

EXTRACT_PRIV_VIRTUAL   = NO

# The INPUT tag is used to specify the files and/or directories that contain
# documented source files. You may enter file names like myfile.cpp or
# directories like /usr/src/myproject. Separate the files or directories with
# spaces. See also FILE_PATTERNS and EXTENSION_MAPPING
# Note: If this tag is empty the current directory is searched.

INPUT                  = @DOXYGEN_INPUT@

# If the GENERATE_HTML tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate HTML output
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_HTML          = NO  # Override libarcstk Doxyfile

# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate LaTeX output.
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_LATEX         = NO  # Override libarcstk Doxyfile

# If the GENERATE_RTF tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate RTF output. The
# RTF output is optimized for Word 97 and may not look too pretty with other RTF
# readers/editors.
# The default value is: NO.

# GENERATE_RTF           = NO

# If the GENERATE_MAN tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate man pages for
# classes and files.
# The default value is: NO.

# GENERATE_MAN           = NO

# If the GENERATE_DOCBOOK tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate Docbook files
# that can be used to generate PDF.
# The default value is: NO.

# GENERATE_DOCBOOK       = NO

# If the GENERATE_PERLMOD tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate a Perl module
# file that captures the structure of the code including all documentation.
#
# Note that this feature is still experimental and incomplete at the moment.
# The default value is: NO.

# GENERATE_PERLMOD       = NO

# If the GENERATE_XML tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate an XML file that
# captures the structure of the code including all documentation.
# The default value is: NO.

GENERATE_XML           = YES  # Override libarcstk Doxyfile

# If the XML_PROGRAMLISTING tag is set to YES, doxygen will dump the program
# listings (including syntax highlighting and cross-referencing information) to
# the XML output. Note that enabling this will significantly increase the size
# of the XML output.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_XML is set to YES.

XML_PROGRAMLISTING     = NO

# If the XML_NS_MEMB_FILE_SCOPE tag is set to YES, doxygen will include
# namespace members in file scope as well, matching the HTML output.
# The default value is: NO.
