\section features Features

Libarcstk supports the following tasks for working with AccurateRip checksums:

- Verify AccurateRip checksums against their reference sums from AccurateRip.
- Calculate the AccurateRip checksums of a sequence of audio samples, may it
  be a single track or an album.
- Calculate the AccurateRip Id of a CD from its toc information (along with the
  request URL and the canonical response filename).
- Parse the responses AccurateRip sends to database requests to plaintext.



\section nonfeatures Non-features

- Libarcstk does not rip CDs.
- Libarcstk does not read, decode or buffer audio data.
- Libarcstk will not send any requests to AccurateRip. Libarcstk has no network
  facilities and is not supposed to get any. The actual HTTP request for
  fetching the reference values is better performed by the HTTP client of your
  choice.
