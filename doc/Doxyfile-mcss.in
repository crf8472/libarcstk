# If the GENERATE_LATEX tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate LaTeX output.
# The default value is: YES.

GENERATE_LATEX         = NO  # Override libarcs Doxyfile

# If the GENERATE_RTF tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate RTF output. The
# RTF output is optimized for Word 97 and may not look too pretty with other RTF
# readers/editors.
# The default value is: NO.

# If the GENERATE_MAN tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate man pages for
# classes and files.
# The default value is: NO.

# that can be used to generate PDF.
# The default value is: NO.

# GENERATE_DOCBOOK       = NO

# If the GENERATE_PERLMOD tag is set to YES, doxygen will generate a Perl module

# If the XML_PROGRAMLISTING tag is set to YES, doxygen will dump the program
# listings (including syntax highlighting and cross-referencing information) to
# the XML output. Note that enabling this will significantly increase the size
# of the XML output.
# The default value is: YES.
# This tag requires that the tag GENERATE_XML is set to YES.

XML_PROGRAMLISTING     = NO

# If the XML_NS_MEMB_FILE_SCOPE tag is set to YES, doxygen will include

# The OUTPUT_DIRECTORY tag is used to specify the (relative or absolute) path
# into which the generated documentation will be written. If a relative path is
# entered, it will be relative to the location where doxygen was started. If
# left blank the current directory will be used.
